# 🚀 Dockerized MERN Application

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application using Docker. It is structured for clarity and ease of implementation.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker** → [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Docker Compose** → [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Git** → [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## 🔹 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
Run the following command to clone the project repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables:
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/mern-app
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### 3️⃣ Build and Run Docker Containers
Each service (Frontend, Backend, Database) has its own Docker image.

#### 🔹 Build Backend Image
```bash
docker build -t backend-image ./backend
```

#### 🔹 Build Frontend Image
```bash
docker build -t frontend-image ./frontend
```

#### 🔹 Start All Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Once running, access the application at:
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### 4️⃣ Stop and Remove Containers
To stop running containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
To remove all volumes as well:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## 🎯 Key Features
✅ **Fully Containerized:** Run the complete MERN stack in isolated environments.
✅ **Scalable Architecture:** Easily scale using Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
✅ **CI/CD Ready:** Implement continuous integration and deployment.
✅ **Secure Configurations:** Manage secrets and environment variables effectively.
✅ **Microservices Approach:** Modular service design for better maintainability.

---

## 📘 Learning Path
### 🔰 Beginner
🔹 Understand the basics of Docker & Docker Compose.
🔹 Create and run a simple Node.js application inside a container.

### 🚀 Intermediate
🔹 Build and containerize a full-stack MERN application.
🔹 Optimize Docker images with `.dockerignore` and multi-stage builds.

### 💡 Advanced
🔹 Deploy Dockerized applications on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
🔹 Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
🔹 Implement Kubernetes for container orchestration.
