# 🚀 Dockerized MERN Application

This guide will help you set up and run a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application using Docker. This document is structured to provide a professional overview suitable for inclusion in a resume or portfolio.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## 🔹 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables:
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/mern-app
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### 3️⃣ Build and Run with Docker

#### 🔹 Build Docker Images
```bash
docker-compose build
```

#### 🔹 Run Containers
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application should now be running at:
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### 4️⃣ Stopping and Removing Containers
```bash
docker-compose down
```
To remove volumes as well:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Containerized Full-Stack Application:** Deploy a fully functional MERN application in isolated environments.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale services using Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
- **Automated Deployment:** Use CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Environment Management:** Utilize `.env` files for secure and flexible configurations.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Implement modular development strategies for better maintainability.

## 📘 Learning Path
To master Docker with a MERN stack, follow these steps:

### 🔰 Beginner
- Learn the basics of Docker and Docker Compose.
- Set up a simple Node.js app with Docker.
- Understand how containers work.

### 🚀 Intermediate
- Build a full-stack MERN application.
- Use Docker Compose for multi-container applications.
- Optimize Docker images with `.dockerignore` and multi-stage builds.

### 💡 Advanced
- Deploy a Dockerized MERN app on cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- Implement Kubernetes for container orchestration.

## 📄 Professional Summary (For Resume & Portfolio)
**Project Title:** Dockerized MERN Application

**Description:** Developed and deployed a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application using Docker for containerization and scalability. Implemented automated deployment with Docker Compose, and optimized services for high availability and efficient resource management.

**Key Responsibilities:**
