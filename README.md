## 🛠 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Docker** → [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Docker Compose** → [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Git** → [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## 🔹 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
Clone the project and navigate to its directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git && cd your-repo
```

### 2️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables:
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/mern-app
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### 3️⃣ Build and Deploy Docker Containers
Each service runs in an independent container for modularity and scalability.

#### 🔹 Build and Tag Docker Images
```bash
# Build Backend Image
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/backend-image ./backend

# Build Frontend Image
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/frontend-image ./frontend
```

#### 🔹 Push Images to Docker Hub
```bash
# Push Backend Image
docker push your-dockerhub-username/backend-image:latest

# Push Frontend Image
docker push your-dockerhub-username/frontend-image:latest
```

#### 🔹 Start the Application with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### 🔹 Access Running Services
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### 4️⃣ Stop and Clean Up Containers
```bash
# Stop running containers
docker-compose down

# Remove containers along with associated data volumes
docker-compose down -v
```
